" AOL Privacy Policy     Last updated: June 23, 2015   "
"AOL is now part of the Verizon family of companies. Additional privacy practices are described in the Verizon Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Verizon Privacy Policy, the AOL Privacy Policy will control when you are on an AOL site or using and AOL product or service.  "
"At AOL, it's our mission to provide users with rich, interactive online experiences. From Pulitzer-Prize winning journalism on the Huffington Post, to the latest technology news on TechCrunch, to up-to-the-minute traffic information on MapQuest, our websites, apps, and other services and software are designed to keep you informed, entertained and delighted. We also operate some of the industry's best-known advertising services, including Adap.tv and Advertising.com.  "
"We're always working to make our services even better. One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in. This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.  "
"This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:     First, the Privacy Policy applies to AOL services that link to or refer to this Privacy Policy. These services include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our ""Services.""     Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.     Third, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices of some of our Services. Although this Privacy Policy applies to all AOL services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too. Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use. We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll let us know.  "
Information We Collect and Receive   We collect and receive information about users in a few different ways:  
"Information you give us . You can give us information directly. For example:     When you sign up for an AOL account you may give us information such as your name, zip code, and date of birth;     When you purchase one of our paid services, you give us your billing information, which may include your credit card data;     When you use Moviefone, you can give us your zip code so that we can tell you where and when movies are playing;     When you post comments in response to a story or video on any of our Services, we-and other users-receive that information; and     When you use the "" My Portfolios"" feature on DailyFinance, you can give us information about your investments so that we can provide you with up-to-the-second market news and commentary relevant to your holdings. (Your use of AOL financial features is subject to additional privacy terms.)     When you otherwise contact us or provide us information directly.  "
"Information we collect or receive when you use our Services . We also collect or receive information when you use our Services. We collect some of this information using cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Depending on how you access and use our Services, we may receive:  "
"Log information . This is information we automatically collect and store when you use our Services or other companies' websites and apps in the AOL Advertising Network. It may include, for example:     Information about your interactions with the websites, apps, and other services you use, the content you view, the search queries you submit, and information in cookies and similar technologies;     Information about how you access those websites, apps, and other services, your browser or operating system, your Internet Protocol (""IP"") address, and the website you visited before visiting our Services.  "
"Device information . This is information we automatically collect and store about the device you use when you access our Services or the services in the AOL Advertising Network. (Note that by ""device,"" we mean anything you use to access our Services. For more information about our privacy practices in connection with mobile devices, please review the Supplemental Mobile Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.) Device information includes, for example:     The type of device you're using (e.g., an iPhone);     Certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device; and     Your Internet service provider.  "
"Location information . This information can include, for example, your device's GPS signal and information about nearby WiFi networks and cell towers. We get this information when you use location-enabled services like MapQuest, which can give you driving directions based on your current location.  "
"Other information . Please note that AOL may use information about your use of certain AOL communication tools (for example, AOL Mail and AOL Instant Messenger); however, when you use AOL communication tools, AOL does not read your private online communications without your consent.  "
"Information from third-party sources . We may receive additional information about you that is publicly or commercially available and combine that with the information we have collected or received about you in other ways. Also, we receive information about you when you choose to connect with social networking services while using our Services. Learn more about how that works here. Additionally, when you use AOL software (such as the AOL desktop software, AOL toolbars, or AIM), we may collect information about other software on your device for the limited purposes of providing the service you are using and improving the security of our services.  "
How We Use the Information We Collect and Receive   We use the information we collect and receive for the following general purposes:  
"To provide our Services. We use the information we collect and receive to provide you with the Services you use or request. For example:     If you request local movie show times from Moviefone, we might use your location information to provide you with times at nearby theaters;     If you sign up to receive the daily headlines from Huffington Post, we'll use your email address to deliver them to you; and     If you ask us to remember your login information for AOL Services, we'll use information stored in cookies when you return to those websites.  "
"To improve our Services . We also use the information we collect and receive to provide content and advertising that people are likely to find relevant and engaging. For example:     If we notice that Huffington Post users in general prefer national political commentary, we might put that content in a special place on the website or in the app;     If we notice that a user is searching for sports cars on AOL Autos, we might show the user an ad for a sports car on AOL.com or on other sites in the AOL Advertising Network; and     If we receive information from users that a Service isn't working properly, we may use that information to address any problem.  "
"To provide effective advertising . Many of our Services are supported by advertising, and some of our Services provide advertising on our websites and apps, and on third-party websites and apps. We use the information we collect and receive to make the advertising we provide more effective. Some of the ways we do this are:     Showing you ads based on your online activities, such as the websites and applications you use, the content you view, and the searches you submit on those applications     Limiting the number of times you see the same ad; and     Measuring the effectiveness of the ads we serve. Learn more about advertising and privacy on our Services.  "
"Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising Services, or Functionality on Our Services  "
"Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more, please visit the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance. For more information about privacy and advertising on our Services, please visit Advertising, Analytics and Privacy.  "
It's important to remember that we don't control the privacy practices of these (or any other) third-party services. So we encourage you to read the privacy policies of the services before connecting to them.  
"""Do Not Track"" Signals   Some web browsers may transmit ""do not track"" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. AOL currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.  "
Choices   You have a number of choices about how we handle your information:  
"  If you're a registered AOL user, you can access your registration information and any billing or shipping information and edit this information by visiting "" My Account.""  "
"  If you're a registered AOL user, you can visit AOL Marketing Preferences to review your marketing preferences and make choices about how your information may be used to provide marketing offers to you. Note that these preferences do not apply to communications that are directly related to your registration with AOL or the fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested (for example, a service advisory from AOL or an acknowledgment of a purchase order).  "
"  Visit our Advertising, Analytics and Privacy page to learn more about your choices related to use of your information for online advertising. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from AOL by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's consumer choice page and selecting AOL Advertising.  "
"  Some of our Services ( AOL Search and Netscape ISP, for example) may also offer you the ability to manage and control information collected or used when you use these services.  "
"  If you're using a mobile device, please visit our Mobile Device Choices page for information about the choices we provide to mobile users.  "
" Our Commitment to Security    Although no one can guarantee the security of the information collected and received, we do employ a number of safeguards intended to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or disclosure of this information. Examples of the types of safeguards we may provide (depending on the circumstances) include:     Storing the data you provide in controlled facilities;     Using HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;     Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their jobs; and     Providing company-wide training on privacy and data security.  "
"Children's Privacy   Our Services are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If you are a parent who consents to the collection of personal information from your child, you agree that your child may use all of our Services and that we may collect, use, and disclose your child's personal information consistent with AOL's Important Note to Parents and this Privacy Policy.

"The Library has implemented safeguards to protect this information, including only providing access to designated Library staff members that require this access to perform their duties.  "
" Automatically Collected Information    The Library of Congress strives to provide the best experience for our Web and SMS users. To that end, the Library automatically collects and stores the following non-personally identifiable information:   The name of the domain from which you access the Internet,     The Internet Protocol address of your Internet provider's gateway, or in some cases, the computer you are using,     The date and time you access the Library's site,     The URL of the pages you visit and files you download,     The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site,     Characteristics of your system, and     Search terms used to come to the site and while on the site (in aggregate only).  "
"This information allows us to improve our website design, presentation and system performance. We collect this information from users who read, browse and/or download information from the Library's websites.  "
"Additionally, if you choose to receive our Library Alerts via text message delivered to cell phones by SMS messaging, we automatically collect your cell phone number so we can send you the Library Alerts. You can opt out of our Library Alerts at any time.  "
" Information Collected for Measurement and Customization (Cookies)    The Library wants to provide our users with the best online experience possible. As such, we use commercial software products to analyze and report on aggregated web metrics data. This data is generally retained indefinitely to support the mission of our Library of Congress web properties.  "
"The Library uses three types of information collecting tools on its various websites: session cookies, persistent cookies, and other customization tools. ""Cookies"" are small files that a website transfers to your computer to allow the site to remember specific information. If you do not want cookies to be transferred to your computer, you may choose to opt out of their use by modifying your browser options. While you will still be able to access most features of the Library's websites, certain features may not work as well or may be unavailable to you.  "
"Session cookies do not contain personal information and once you close your browser, the cookies disappear. The Library uses session cookies on our site for technical purposes such as to enable you to more easily navigate throughout the Library's websites. Session cookies only collect non-personally identifiable data.  "
"Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time and across multiple sessions. The Library never uses persistent cookies to collect personal identifiable information about our website visitors. The Library uses persistent cookies to improve our web metrics by distinguishing between new and returning visitors; to prevent repeated prompting to complete our customer satisfaction survey, to anonymously aggregate data on how visitors use our sites and to ""remember"" preferences that you voluntarily provide in order to create a more seamless experience.  "
Customization tools allow you to voluntarily provide information to personalize and improve your online experience on a particular Library website. This information is saved on our servers.  
" Personal Information    In order to use certain features of the Library's websites, you may need to submit personal information so we can respond appropriately. We will inform you what information we require and will only use it for the stated purpose. Examples include making a purchase from the Library's online gift shop, requesting a response on a feedback form and participating in the Library's wikis or blog areas. By providing the information, you are giving consent to the Library to use the information for the stated purpose; if you do not want to provide the information, the feature will not be available to you.  "
" Children's Privacy Policy    Children are naturally curious about our world and the Library considers it part of its mission to reach out to them in creative and educational ways that protect their privacy. Certain Library websites offer educational content to children under 13 and this privacy policy, which complies with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), will be available at these sites by a link.  "
"Some of these sites provide games and activities, and occasionally, we collect personally identifiable information in order to complete the one-time game or activity. We do not use the information for any other purpose and delete the information as soon as practical. For example, in our Lifelong Literacy area, children can create an online picture postcard and email it to a friend. In order to send the online postcard, we need both email addresses as well as the child's first name so that the recipient will know who sent the card. This information is not retained. If the child chooses to post the online postcard in our gallery, we will not post any personally identifying information.  "
"If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has made a request for information, for example through our Ask a Librarian forms, we will respond to the request and any identifying information will be deleted once we have responded. Similarly, if we become aware that a child under 13 posted personally identifiable information on any of our websites, we will also delete that information.  "
"We take children's privacy very seriously, and encourage parents to contact us with any questions or concerns they may have via the web form at www.loc.gov/contact/web-site-comments/. Additionally, if parents want us to delete any collected personally identifiable information about their children under the age of 13, they can also contact us at the website address listed above.  "
" Linking to the Library's Website    As a publicly supported U.S. Government institution, the Library generally does not own rights in its collections and what is posted on its website. Therefore, it does not charge permission fees for use of such material and generally does not grant or deny permission to publish or otherwise distribute material on its website. However, the Library requests that your link to the Library's website be presented in a manner that does not give the impression that the Library is making an express or implied endorsement of any good or service provided on your website and that the link is presented in a manner that clearly indicates that the user is leaving one site and accessing another.

"In terms of our own use of information, we may use your personally identifiable information for the activities described in the previous sections, and for internal purposes and marketing, promotional and fundraising purposes in support of public broadcasting.  "
"We will typically explain the extent of use at the time you are asked to provide personal information.

You can change your video and audio preferences at any time, or choose a player each time you view of listen to a clip.  A cookie will tell us which pages you visit and the amount of time between each page visit. The cookie does not remember any information about you or your computer; it just helps us at PBS monitor Site usage and traffic; for example, it allows us to measure the number of repeat visitors to pbs.org in a given month. This data is only used in the aggregate. "
"IV. HOW CAN I ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION-   Access to personally identifiable information that is collected from our Site may be accessible for a limited period of time from the point of collection, such as where a user provides an e-mail address in order to receive an e-mail newsletter or a reminder about an upcoming program or event. In other cases, personally identifiable information may be maintained, edited and deleted at the user's discretion at any time after the information has been submitted to PBS. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Site, you may be able to access that account to review the information you provided and make corrections and updates as necessary. However this feature is not available throughout our Site where the user is not asked to create an account. Therefore, if at any time, you prefer not to receive e-mail from a service that you subscribed to without creating a personal account, simply get out by following the unsubscribe options at the bottom of each e-mail.

SRL can be contacted by mail, phone, facsimile, or by e-mail at SRL, as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Statement.  "
"1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors   SRL may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SRL via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.  "
"SRL may place Internet ""cookies"" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of the Site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, SRL may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly, for example, in pre-filling forms. Visitors may decline or remove Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.  "
"SRL also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and activity on the Site. A Web bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.  "
"When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SRL may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. SRL may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.  "
"With respect to chat rooms, SRL does not, and is not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Site, or the content therein, where users transmit or post communications or communicate with each other regarding SRL or Content (see Terms and Conditions) on the Site, including but not limited to, communications in chat rooms, bulletin boards or other user forums.

"
"4. Use of Personal Data Collected Personal data collected by SRL may be used by SRL for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or record-keeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to SRL may be added to SRL's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.  "
"With respect to visitor e-mail addresses, we allow users to post their e-mail address on comments or in sponsorships, in the event that they wish to allow others to reach them easily. Visitor e-mail addresses from comments are not used by SRL to generate mailing lists.  "
"SRL also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the Terms and Conditions, any subscriber agreement, this Privacy Statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.  "

"
"6. Security Measures   SRL has implemented numerous security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information.

"7. Opt-Out Right   Except as necessary for SRL to provide the services, information, or products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his or her personally identifiable information, which has been voluntarily provided to SRL through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription, prospectively retained by SRL, used by SRL for secondary purposes, or disclosed by SRL to third parties by contacting SRL via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses set out above. (This does not apply to collection of the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided or collected that does not meet the above description.)

" What Information We Collect and How We Use It    We do not require children to share any personal information in order to participate on this Site. On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from a child as part of an activity, in accordance with COPPA. For example:  "
"Email address: We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a one-time request from the child, such as if the child asks us or one of our authors a question. In such case, we promptly delete the child's email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the child's email address for any other purpose.  "
"Send-a-friend: In the case of send-a-friend email or card, we only collect a child's first name and the friend's email address to send the friend the email or card. We do not store the friend's email address for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the email or card to the friend.  "
"Email newsletters: We may collect a child's email address if the child wishes to sign up for our email newsletters. In such instance, the child will be asked to provide his or her email address and the email address of his or her parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a notification email informing them of the child's request to receive the newsletter by email on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or her child's information removed from our newsletter database. If the newsletter is declined, we will not send the newsletter and will delete any related personal information collected in the sign-up process from our files. If the newsletter is not declined, we will send the newsletter. All newsletters contain instructions so that the recipient may unsubscribe at any time.  "
"Contests or Sweepstakes: We may collect a child's email address to enter the child in a sweepstakes or contest or to notify the child that he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes or contest. We will not keep the child's email address after the promotion or use the child's email address for any other purpose other than for the promotion. For certain promotions, we may ask that a child give us his/her parent's email address so we can obtain more personalized information for prize fulfillment purposes if the child wins the promotion or to notify the parent if we need more than the child's email address to enter the child in the promotion. In the latter event, parents will be sent a notice along with instructions on how they may provide their consent for their child to participate in such promotion.  "
"We may also collect anonymous information automatically from your child's computer or device, such as the frequency with which the child visits our Site and the pages visited, to support the internal operations of the Site. We collect this information so we can understand and monitor usage of the Site, customize content on the Site and improve the performance of the Site.

This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes, email newsletters and offers, provide subscriptions, participate in chat rooms and message boards, or offer other online activities.

We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.  "
"Unique application numbers   Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.  "
Local storage   We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.  
"Information we collect when you are signed in to Google may be associated with your Google Account. When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your Google Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.  "
" How we use information we collect    We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more relevant search results and ads.  "
"When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.  "
"We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.  "
"Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.  "
"We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services - for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.  "
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.  
Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.  
" Transparency and choice    People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:     Visit your Google Account History for settings that allow you to control the collection of personal information from Google services, such as Search, YouTube and Location History.     Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.     View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.     Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.     Control who you share information with through your Google Account.     Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.     Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.  "
"You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it's important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.  "
" Accessing and updating your personal information    Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.  "
"We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).  "
"Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.  "
" Information security    We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:     We encrypt many of our services using SSL.     We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.     We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.     We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.  "
" When this Privacy Policy applies    Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.  "
"Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.  "
" Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities    We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.  "
" Changes    Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.  "

We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.  
"Users that register for Latin Post's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Latin Post's. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, Latin Post's, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.  "
"a. Registration. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Latin Post'swireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the ""single opt-in"" or the ""double-opt-in"" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Latin Post's depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the ""double opt-in"" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.  "
"i. Single Opt-in Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Latin Posts will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Latin Posts to send text messages to him or her. Latin Posts will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a ""Thank you"" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Latin Posts or by sending a text message to Latin Posts that says ""STOP"", ""END"", ""CANCEL"", ""REMOVE"", ""UNSUBSCRIBE"" or ""QUIT"".  "
"ii. Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Latin Post's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Latin Post's) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Latin Post's will then send a ""Confirmation"" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Latin Post's to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the ""Confirmation"" message with a text message that states ""YES"" or ""Y"" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Latin Post's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the ""Confirmation"" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the ""Confirmation"" message at any time provided that Latin Post may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the ""Confirmation"" is only valid if the response is received while Latin Post continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.  "
"iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Latin Post will then send a ""Confirmation"" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Latin Post to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the ""Confirmation"" message with a text message that states ""YES"" or ""Y"" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Latin Post wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the ""Confirmation"" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the ""Confirmation"" message at any time provided that Latin Post may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the ""Confirmation"" is only valid if the response is received while Latin Post continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.  "
"b. Termination of Wireless Services by User. Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Latin Post by the following procedure:  "
"A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Latin Post at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says ""STOP"", ""END"", ""CANCEL"", ""REMOVE"", ""UNSUBSCRIBE"" or ""QUIT"". Latin Post will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word ""ALL"" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Latin Post. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Latin Post service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.  "
"c. Termination of Wireless Services by Latin Post. A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Latin Post may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Latin Post may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.  "
" 7. Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.    Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by clicking ""Account"" on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID to change, update or deactivate your Personal Information. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.  "
"You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking ""Profile"" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting ""Edit Profile"" or ""Manage Account"" and selecting the ""Privacy"" tab.  "
"Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.  "
"If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.  "
"Children or Ineligible Teenagers.. If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (""Ineligible Teenagers""), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the ""Parent"") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).  "
"In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the ""Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use"" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Latin Post will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Latin Post will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.  "
" 8. Protection of Information.    While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.  "
"Phishing. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. ""Phishers"" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at admin@latinpost.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.  "
" 9. Your California Privacy Rights.    If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as ""unsubscribe"") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.  "
"If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator at admin@latinpost.com or by postal mail to Latin Post, 250 Vesey Street, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10281, Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy Administrator.

" 11. Miscellaneous.    a. Accuracy and Confidentiality. It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information. We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.  "
"You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for the activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site under your User ID (whether used by you or any others who use your User ID), unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party.

" Information Collection and Use    Information Collection   RedOrbit, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on RedOrbit.com. RedOrbit, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.  "
"Registration   In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  "
"Order   We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.  "
"Cookies   A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies [and] persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.  "
"We use cookies to enhance the RedOrbit experience. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings that take place. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the 'Profile' section.  "
"Log Files   Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user?s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information We use a tracking utility called ClickTracks that uses log files to analyze user movement.  "
"Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)   We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users? personally identifiable information.  "
"Clear Gifs can ""work with"" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited 'www.companyX.com', which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer.  "
"In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.  "
" Communications from the Site    Special Offers and Updates   We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.  "
"Newsletter   If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.  "
"Service Announcements   On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.  "
"Customer Service   We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.  "
"Choice/Opt-out   Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.  "
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.  
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.  
"Tell-A-Friend   If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. RedOrbit, Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. RedOrbit, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact RedOrbit, Inc. to request the removal of this information from our database.  "
"Security   This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.  "
"When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.  "
"While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility.  "
Supplementation of Information   In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.  
"Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information   If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support.  "
"Notification of Changes   If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.  "
"If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.  "

Kaleida Health will always notify you of any cost involved so that you may choose to withdraw or modify your request before any costs are incurred.  "
"Ordinarily Kaleida Health will respond to your request for an accounting within 60 days. If we need additional time to prepare the accounting you have requested, we will notify you in writing about the reason for the delay and the date when you can expect to receive the accounting. In rare cases, Kaleida Health may have to delay providing you with the accounting without notifying you because a law enforcement official or government agency has asked us to do so.  "
" 4. Right To Request Additional Privacy Protections    You have the right to request that we further restrict the way Kaleida Health uses and discloses your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations. If your restriction applies to disclosure of information to a health plan where you paid in full out of pocket for items or services, and the disclosure is not otherwise required by law, we are required to honor that request. You may also request that we limit how we disclose information about you to family or friends involved in your care. For example, you could request that we not disclose information about a surgery you had. To request restrictions, please write to the Kaleida Health Privacy Officer, 726 Exchange Street Suite 200, Buffalo, NY 14210. Your request should include (1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit how we use the information, how we share it with others, or both; and (3) to whom you want the limits to apply.  "
"Except as noted above, Kaleida Health is not required to agree to your request for a restriction, and in some cases the restriction you request may not be permitted under law. However, if Kaleida Health does agree, we will be bound by our agreement unless the information is needed to provide you with emergency treatment or comply with the law. Once Kaleida Health has agreed to a restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any time. Under some circumstances, Kaleida will also have the right to revoke the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so; in other cases, we will need your permission before we can revoke the restriction.  "
" 5. Right To Request Confidential Communications    You have the right to request that we communicate with you about your medical matters in a more confidential way by requesting that Kaleida Health communicates with you by alternative means or at alternative locations. For example, you may ask that we contact you at home instead of at work.  "
"To request more confidential communications, please write to the Kaleida Health Privacy Officer, 726 Exchange Street Suite 200, Buffalo, NY 14210. Kaleida Health will not ask you the reason for your request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests. Please specify in your request how or where you wish to be contacted, and how payment for your health care will be handled if Kaleida Health communicates with you through this alternative method or location."

The information you share with Walmart allows us to provide the products and services you need and want while giving you the very best shopping experience.  "
"Our founder Sam Walton reminded us that ""a promise we make is a promise we keep,"" and it's our promise to customers that we respect the trust you place in us and the privacy of the information you share. Part of providing superior customer service includes making sure that we're building a relationship of trust with customers. Our way of doing that is to let you know in a clear, prominent, and easily accessible way how we collect, use, share, and above all protect your personal information.  "
"Our Policy outlines:     How and why we collect your personal information;     How your personal information is used and protected;     When and with whom we share your personal information; and     What choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your personal information.  "
" What Does Our Privacy Policy Include?    Our Policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information:   At Walmart and Amigo retail stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and     On our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted.

"Our Policy focuses on personal information - - information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you. For example, when you place an item on layaway or place an order online, we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information.  "
"We have additional, specific privacy notices related to some of our specialized operations. For example, our Health Wellness operations (pharmacy and vision center) have a specific Notice of Privacy Practices for their personal information practices. Our specialized notices can be found here.  "

" What Type of Information Do We Collect?    We collect two types of information: (1) information we receive from you and (2) information we receive from others. Information we receive from you includes information you share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our websites. This also includes information you provide us through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your computer when you visit our websites. We also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records, improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud. Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.  "

" Information We Receive From You    You share information with us in various ways in our stores and online. For example, you share information when you:     Make an in-store or online purchase, or other transaction, with us;     Create an account on one of our websites or mobile services;     Use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list;     Participate in our programs, such as Savings Catcher or eReceipts;     Conduct a transaction or request a service where we collect information (including when required by law, such as hunting and fishing licenses);     Request customer service or contact us;     Post a review or comment on one of our social media pages, or post a rating, review or other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services; and     Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey.  "
"When you engage in these activities, you may share different types of personal information with us, such as your name, email address, physical or postal address, phone number, date of birth, and payment information.  "
You also provide us information in other ways through technology. Some of this information may be linked to you personally. This information helps our websites and mobile services work correctly and supports our customer marketing and analytics efforts - - our work to understand our customers' needs and provide information about our products and services. Here are some examples:  
" Device Information:  We collect technical information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services.

Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.     We use an opt-out standard for email or for other communications, such as postal mail. Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below). Please note that these standards may not apply to communications regarding our Health Wellness operations, such as prescription reminders.

"Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes.

" Do Not Track Disclosure    Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI ""Consumer Opt-out"" link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

" Apps    If you install one of our apps on your mobile device, your use of the app is subject to our app license agreement, http://dictionary.reference.com/help/dictionaryappeula.html.  "
" Children's privacy    We do allow children under 13 to register for an account, but we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. Personally identifiable information, for example, includes a first and last name; a home or other physical address; an e-mail address; a telephone number; or a social security number.  "
"When we have identified through our age-screening process that a child under 13 is trying to register an account with us, we immediately ""hash"" that user's e-mail into a nonreversible character string and discard the e-mail. Then the user's e-mail address is only used for ""password recovery"" purposes.  "
"Generally speaking, one-way hashing is a way to anonymize or hide data by transforming pieces of information into fixed strings of alphanumeric characters.  "
"For example, when the e-mail address 'U13user@dictionary.com' is hashed, the result or ""hash value"" might be 'a8der13ap69'. Every time that hash function is applied to that e-mail address the result will be the same. It is called one-way hashing because the function allows you to convert the data only one way. So while it is possible to convert an e-mail address into a hash value, it is not possible to convert that value back into the e-mail address.  "
"When a child under the age of 13 registers for an account, we use hashing to create a password reminder system that does not require us to retain that child's email address. To do this, we apply the hash function to the email address and associate the resulting hash value (not the e-mail) with the user's account. The e-mail address is immediately discarded after the hash function is applied.  "
"When the user forgets the password associated with the account, we request the original email address, hash it, and then compare the two hash values. If they match, we e-mail the password reminder to the user and then immediately discard the e-mail again.  "
" Information from users outside the United States    If you're outside the United States, your information will be sent to and stored in the United States, where our servers are located. By using our sites and apps, you agree to the information collection, use, and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.  "
" YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (as provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)    A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (""California customer"") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.  "
"We have opted for this alternative approach. If you would like to modify any personal information you previously submitted our sites or apps, visit your account information section for each site or app to which you made the submission. If you have agreed to receive communications from us or to permit us to share your personal information with third parties, you may request that, in the future, we not send you communications or share your personal information by writing to our Legal Department at our corporate address below or by visiting your account information section for each site or app. Please note, however, that we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to the site or app (e.g., about changes to this Privacy Policy).
